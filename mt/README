-both programs took under ten minutes on this computer to run fully

-Dumb output had a higher f-score but the noisychannel output seemed more reasonable - the dumb
method of decoding seems to reward solely what we defined as "correct" alignment (words being on 
the same line as the right translations) while the bigram language model lends itself to more
readable English.

-our method of evaluation rewards a more exact translation technically speaking but doesn't reward
highly readable English

-fscore for verydumb: .563
-fscore for noisychannel: .526
