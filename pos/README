-I ran the viterbi algorithm once per sentence
-I used two hashtables to store my already-gotten values in use of the viterbi algorithm: 
one to store the probabilities for each tag at the given position in the sentence, and one to keep
track of the previous tag for each tag and each position in the sentence (otherwise the tag positions
would get overwritten by my error tag corresponding to a tag sequence/tau value with probability 0)
-In the dumb unk tagging, I gave each (tag, *UNK*) pair a tau value of 1, and the percentage of
correct tags was 93.2; if I gave each such pair a value of 1/(n_tag + 1), the correct tag percentage
was 92.6.
-With better tagging 93.6 of the tags were correct
-No bugs!
