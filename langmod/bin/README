-Both programs ran semi-instantly
-alpha value = ~1.59
-beta value = ~90
-I used a recursive golden section search to maximize the likelihood of smoothing parameters
on held-out data
-I used lists to store the word pairs used in the bigram model; using arrays would take in pointers
to the memory, not the word pair itself, so lists were necessary
-no real bugs!
