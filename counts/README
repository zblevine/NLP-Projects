I used a hash table to map each word to the number of times used - I would add one to the value for each word if the word was already there.

I then enumerated the hash table to create an array of lines containing each word and the number of times that word was used. I then wrote each line to the output file.

Imports: 
from java.util - Enumeration, Hashtable, List, Vector
from java.nio.file - Files, Paths, Path
