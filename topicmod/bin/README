Some inconsistencies: 

-although article 17 is about international politics, and topic 49 was determined to have 100
percent probability (in other iterations the probability for the main topic would be between
99 and 100 percent) the top 15 terms for topic 49 were all related to U.S. politics (except "China").
Perhaps many political terms were lumped together by the algorithm, but perhaps too many words ended
up in topic 49.

-Most of the topics had fewer than 15 words in them. I had a bug earlier where all the words would
eventually settle into one topic. Perhaps something similar yet less deleterious happened here where
a disproportionate number of words ended up in a few topics (this would corroborate the irregularity
in the populous topic 49 that I noted above)

-This took only a couple minutes to run.
